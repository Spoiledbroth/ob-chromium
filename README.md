# ob-chromium.pl
This is a small Perl script which will (hopefully) transform your `chromium` or `google-chrome` bookmarks file (usually located in your browser's profile directory in `~/.config/`) into an Openbox pipe menu.
## Dependencies
This script depends on the Perl module JSON::Tiny which can be downloaded with CPAN by executing `perl -MCPAN -e 'install JSON::Tiny'` in a terminal.
## Installation
For more information about using pipe menus in Openbox/LXDE check out the [wiki documentation for pipe menus.](http://openbox.org/wiki/Help:Menus#Pipe_menus)
